### chitchat
I have this idea from a while now but I didn't have the courage to do it,
may be because i wasn't aware enough about clean coding or something like that. 
Whatever we are here now, 

### why this repo?
Simply, I am in English commerce college and I study accounting which is all about adding, subtracting, adding again, some multipilcations, then back to substracting, and the most important tables, So I started thinking, I know pandas and make a lot of tables equations and I learn accounting and make myself dirty with pencils and this blue ink on my hand every time I solve a problem. So, why not ? study accounting subjects by pandas and extra knowledging myself with pandas.

here we start our journey - I am only one year of graduation, there is three years missed - okay, let's be fair, it will be a family picnic.
